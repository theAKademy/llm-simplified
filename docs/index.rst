Overview
========

Hyperledger Fabric is a modular and extensible framework for building blockchain solutions with:

- A permissioned network
- Consensus flexibility
- Privacy and confidentiality
- High performance and scalability

With Hyperledger Fabric, businesses can create secure and efficient distributed applications. It's ideal for industries requiring transparency and trust, such as finance, supply chain, and healthcare.

Key Features
============

- **Modular Architecture**: Hyperledger Fabric is designed with plug-and-play components such as consensus and smart contracts (chaincode).
- **High Scalability**: Fabric's architecture is designed to scale as needed, supporting thousands of transactions per second (TPS).
- **Private Transactions**: Hyperledger Fabric allows for the confidentiality of transactions via channels and private data collections.
- **Smart Contracts**: Also known as chaincode, these are the programs that define the business logic of your blockchain application.

Installation
============

To install Hyperledger Fabric, follow the instructions in the official installation guide.

1. **Install Prerequisites**: Ensure that Docker, Go, and Node.js are installed on your system.
2. **Download Fabric Binaries**: Download the required binaries using the official release or the Fabric installer.
3. **Set Up Fabric Network**: Use the provided sample networks to set up your first Fabric network.

.. tip::
    Make sure to check the [Installation Guide](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-2.5/installation.html) for complete installation instructions.

Architecture
============

Hyperledger Fabric is designed for scalability and performance. Below is an overview of its core components:

- **Peers**: Nodes in the network that validate transactions and maintain the ledger.
- **Orderers**: Nodes responsible for ordering transactions and broadcasting them to peers.
- **Channels**: Logical networks within the Fabric network that allow privacy and data isolation.
- **Chaincode**: Smart contracts that define the logic of transactions on the blockchain.

Consensus
=========

Hyperledger Fabric supports various consensus mechanisms, and the default mechanism is **Raft**. Consensus in Fabric ensures the order and validation of transactions in a distributed ledger.

For more on consensus mechanisms, visit the [Consensus page](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-2.5/consensus.html).

Security
========

Hyperledger Fabric provides enterprise-level security features to ensure the privacy and confidentiality of transactions. Some key security features include:

- **Identity Management**: Fabric uses X.509 certificates for identity management and authenticating transactions.
- **Access Control**: Access to data is controlled using policies and membership services.
- **Confidentiality**: Channels and private data collections help keep transactions confidential.

Smart Contracts (Chaincode)
===========================

Smart contracts, or **chaincode**, are written in Go, Java, or JavaScript and run on the Fabric network. Chaincode defines the business logic for your blockchain application.

To learn how to create your first chaincode, visit the [Chaincode Documentation](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-2.5/chaincode.html).

Getting Started
===============

To get started with Hyperledger Fabric, you can follow the tutorials available on the website. These tutorials guide you through setting up your first blockchain network, writing and deploying chaincode, and interacting with the network.
